🔧 STRUCTURE FOR SEO-OPTIMIZED PAGES
Each page will follow this exact framework:

✅ 1. SEO TITLE & META DESCRIPTION
Title Tag:
Format: [Primary Keyword] | FRAME
Example: Hidden Cost of Manufacturing Obsolescence | FRAME

Meta Description (150–160 characters):
Example: Discover the hidden costs of legacy systems in manufacturing. Learn how to assess obsolescence risk and build a proactive upgrade strategy.

✅ 2. HEADER STRUCTURE & PAGE LAYOUT
Use structured H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy. Page is built as an educational long-form post optimized for both readers and search engines.

🟦 H1: [Exact Keyword Phrase]
Example: Hidden Cost of Manufacturing Obsolescence

Introductory paragraph (100–150 words):

Define the concept

Highlight relevance in modern operations

State what the page will cover

Add strong opening line for featured snippet optimization

🟨 H2: Why This Matters on the Plant Floor
Explain real-world relevance:

Where the issue shows up (panels, systems, meetings)

Risk factors (unplanned downtime, lack of visibility)

Short-term vs long-term implications

📌 Include bolded insights and internal FRAME references
📷 Optional supporting image: plant scenario or KPI trend

🟨 H2: Signs and Signals to Watch For
Bullet points or checklist format:

Physical, procedural, and data-based indicators

Quotes from operators/technicians (if available)

Panel conditions, response delays, or metric blind spots

🧠 H3 (optional): Examples from FRAME Readers
Embed quotes or anonymized stories

🟨 H2: How to Assess and Act
Provide a FRAME-style mini playbook:

3–5 step process to assess or take action

Tables or checklists if applicable

Reference real factory tools: centerlines, DDS, SOPs

🧩 H3: Common Pitfalls
List mistakes or misinterpretations (Ex: “Swapping parts isn’t a strategy.”)

🟨 H2: Broader Strategy Alignment
Connect issue to larger frameworks:

Ties to operational resilience, metrics, floor leadership

Fit within TPM, Six Sigma, DDS, AI rollout, etc.

📘 H3: When This Becomes a Leadership Challenge
Explain how poor standards or misaligned teams block progress

🟨 H2: How FRAME Readers Handle This
Highlight a story, podcast clip, or a relevant Joltek video
