Here are 10 high‚Äërelevance manufacturing case studies aligned with FRAME‚Äôs themes: operational resilience, obsolescence management, metrics, AI/IIoT, ERP improvements, and Lean/Quick Response strategies. Each entry includes detailed summaries so you can build rich resource pages.

1. PLC Obsolescence Upgrade at Polytron (Drywall Manufacturer)
Challenge: Aging PLC‚Äë5 controllers causing downtime, scarce spare parts.

Solution: Multi‚Äësite upgrade to ControlLogix systems, plus HMI and network overhaul.

Outcome: Improved reliability, lower MRO inventory, reduced unplanned downtime

2. Toyota‚Äôs Quick Response to Aisin Fire (Resilience in JIT)
Context: 1997 fire destroyed Toyota‚Äôs sole P‚Äëvalve supplier‚Äîrisking JIT operations.

Action: Coordinated alternative factories‚Äîeven from unrelated industries‚Äîto produce valves in 3 days.

Result: Avoided major production halt; learned to build slack & supplier redundancy

3. Digital Twin Line Reconfiguration for Battery Plant
Project: Smart‚Äëfactory digital twin to handle disturbances in production line.

Method: Reconfiguration optimizer dynamically reassigns resources to maintain throughput.

Results: Prevented 26% and 63% drops in throughput in two scenarios; optimization in 0.03s
